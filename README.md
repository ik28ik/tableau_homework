### Citi Bike Analytics

This repo contains homework from the Tableau lecture series from The Columbia Engineering Data Analytics Boot Camp.


In this assignment:
* The data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs was aggregated
* Designed 7 visualizations for each discovered phenomena:
	* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?
	* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
	* What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
	* What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 
	* What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 
	* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?* How does the average trip duration change by age?
* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
* Two Tableau dashboards that brings together the visualizations:
	* Peek Hours and Top Stations 
	* Bikes by Gender 
* A Tableau Story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
